# Service Baseline Methodology

## Executive Summary

This document explains how we selected, categorized, and tiered retirement plan services within the Fee Benchmarking Application. The service baseline framework provides context for fee analysis by helping advisors and plan sponsors understand which services are essential for compliance, which are industry-standard, and which represent premium value-added offerings.

## Purpose and Business Value

### Why Service Baselines Matter

Fee benchmarking alone can be misleading without understanding the services provided. A lower fee that excludes essential compliance services represents a fiduciary risk, while a higher fee that includes comprehensive support may deliver superior value. Our service baseline framework enables:

1. **Informed Decision-Making**: Plan sponsors can evaluate whether fees are reasonable given the scope of services
2. **Compliance Risk Identification**: Essential services required for ERISA compliance are clearly flagged
3. **Apples-to-Apples Comparisons**: Service differences between existing and proposed providers are transparent
4. **Value Quantification**: Premium services that justify higher fees are identified

## Methodology Overview

### Data Sources

Our service categorization is based on publicly available industry standards and regulatory requirements:

1. **Department of Labor (DOL) ERISA 408(b)(2) Fee Disclosure Requirements**
   - Federal regulation requiring service providers to disclose services and compensation
   - Establishes baseline service descriptions for recordkeepers, advisors, and TPAs
   - Source: [DOL ERISA Regulations](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa)

2. **National Association of Plan Advisors (NAPA) Research**
   - Annual surveys of plan advisors on service provider performance
   - Data on which services matter most for plan success
   - Responsiveness and service quality research
   - Source: [NAPA Industry Research](https://www.napa-net.org/)

3. **Provider Disclosure Documents**
   - Public 408(b)(2) disclosures from major providers (Fidelity, Schwab, Empower, etc.)
   - Standard service offerings documented in regulatory filings
   - Common industry practices across provider tiers

4. **Industry Benchmarking Services**
   - PLANSPONSOR recordkeeper surveys
   - MyShortlister and PayrollIntegrations provider comparisons
   - Plan size-specific service expectations

### Three-Tier Classification System

We classify services into three tiers based on regulatory requirements, industry standards, and plan size appropriateness:

#### Essential (Tier 1)
**Definition**: Core services required for basic plan operation and ERISA fiduciary compliance

**Criteria for Classification**:
- Required by DOL, IRS, or ERISA regulations
- Necessary to avoid fiduciary breach
- Cannot operate a compliant plan without these services
- Expected by 95%+ of plans regardless of size

**Visual Indicator**: Red badge (E) in the application

#### Standard (Tier 2)
**Definition**: Services expected by most plans in the applicable market segment

**Criteria for Classification**:
- Included in 60-90% of provider offerings for the plan size
- Industry best practice but not legally required
- Enhance participant experience and plan efficiency
- Absence may indicate service gaps relative to peers

**Visual Indicator**: Blue badge (S) in the application

#### Premium (Tier 3)
**Definition**: Enhanced services that provide additional value beyond standard offerings

**Criteria for Classification**:
- Offered by leading providers as differentiators
- Provide significant operational or participant experience benefits
- Justify higher fees through enhanced capabilities
- Typically found in 30-60% of providers

**Visual Indicator**: Purple badge (P) in the application

## Plan Size-Based Service Expectations

### Rationale for Size-Based Benchmarks

Plan service needs vary significantly by assets under management (AUM). Larger plans have greater complexity, regulatory scrutiny, and participant counts that justify more comprehensive service packages. Our research identified three distinct market segments:

### Under $5M AUM (Small Plans)

**Service Philosophy**: Focus on essential compliance services with cost-effective automation

**Expected Service Levels**:
- **Advisor**: Minimum 3 services (all essential)
- **Recordkeeper**: Minimum 4 services (essential + basic standard)
- **TPA**: Minimum 3 services (essential only)

**Rationale**: Small plans have limited budgets and fewer participants. Providers often target this segment with streamlined, technology-driven solutions. Based on analysis of providers like Guideline, Human Interest, and ADP targeting small businesses.

**Data Source**: Small business 401(k) provider comparison from MyShortlister and PayrollIntegrations (2024).

### $5M - $50M AUM (Mid-Market Plans)

**Service Philosophy**: Essential services plus most standard services for robust plan operation

**Expected Service Levels**:
- **Advisor**: Minimum 5 services (essential + key standard)
- **Recordkeeper**: Minimum 6 services (essential + standard features)
- **TPA**: Minimum 5 services (essential + standard compliance)

**Rationale**: Mid-market plans represent the largest segment by plan count. Industry competition has established clear service expectations. Most providers offer comprehensive standard packages at this tier.

**Data Source**: T. Rowe Price, Principal Financial Group, and Paychex standard service packages for mid-market segment.

### Over $50M AUM (Large Plans)

**Service Philosophy**: Comprehensive service packages including premium features

**Expected Service Levels**:
- **Advisor**: Minimum 6 services (essential + standard + select premium)
- **Recordkeeper**: Minimum 8 services (full-service platform)
- **TPA**: Minimum 6 services (complete administration suite)

**Rationale**: Large plans have complex needs, greater fiduciary scrutiny, and sophisticated plan sponsors who expect premium service levels. Fee levels justify comprehensive support.

**Data Source**: Vanguard, Fidelity, and Empower service offerings for large plan segment. Industry research from PLANSPONSOR on large plan expectations.

## Service Value Scoring Methodology

### Weighted Scoring System

Our application calculates a **Service Value Score (0-100)** using a weighted system that reflects service importance:

- **Essential Services**: 3x weight (compliance-critical)
- **Standard Services**: 2x weight (industry expectations)
- **Premium Services**: 1x weight (value-added enhancements)

**Formula**:
```
Service Value Score =
  [(Essential % × 3) + (Standard % × 2) + (Premium % × 1)]
  / (3 + 2 + 1) × 100
```

**Rationale**: Essential services are weighted most heavily because missing these services represents compliance risk and operational failure regardless of cost savings. Standard services are weighted moderately as they represent industry expectations. Premium services receive standard weight as they're value-added rather than required.

### Provider-Specific Weighting

The overall score is a weighted average across provider types:

- **Advisor Services**: 35% (critical fiduciary role)
- **Recordkeeper Services**: 35% (daily participant interaction)
- **TPA Services**: 25% (compliance backbone)
- **Audit Services**: 5% (required but narrow scope)

**Rationale**: Advisors and recordkeepers have the greatest impact on plan success and participant outcomes based on NAPA research on service provider importance. TPA services, while essential, are more narrowly scoped. Audits are required but limited in scope.

## Quality Assurance and Validation

### Internal Validation

1. **Regulatory Review**: All essential service classifications were validated against DOL and IRS regulations by reviewing official guidance documents
2. **Industry Benchmarking**: Service tiers compared against 25+ provider disclosure documents
3. **Market Research**: Classification validated against NAPA, PLANSPONSOR, and industry surveys

### Ongoing Maintenance

This service baseline framework will be reviewed and updated:

- **Annually**: To reflect regulatory changes and market evolution
- **As Needed**: When significant industry changes occur (new regulations, technology shifts)

### Limitations and Disclaimers

1. **General Guidance**: Service baselines represent typical industry standards but individual plan needs may vary
2. **Not Legal Advice**: This framework provides benchmarking context but does not constitute legal or fiduciary advice
3. **Provider Variation**: Specific provider offerings may differ from baseline expectations
4. **Plan-Specific Needs**: Unique plan characteristics may require services not reflected in standard tiers

---

## Using the Service Framework

### For Advisors

**Fee Proposal Context**: When presenting fee proposals, reference service tiers to help sponsors understand:
- Which services are table stakes vs. premium offerings
- Whether proposed fees are justified by service scope
- What service gaps exist in current or proposed arrangements

**RFP Evaluation**: Use service baselines to ensure RFP responses are evaluated consistently:
- Score providers on essential service coverage
- Identify missing standard services that may indicate subpar offerings
- Evaluate whether premium services justify fee premiums

### For Plan Sponsors

**Service Adequacy**: Understand whether your current provider offers:
- All essential services (avoiding compliance gaps)
- Standard services appropriate for your plan size
- Premium services that provide real value

**Fee Reasonableness**: Evaluate fees in context:
- Low fees with missing essential services = fiduciary risk
- Market-rate fees with comprehensive services = reasonable value
- High fees should include premium service justification

### For Compliance Teams

**Documentation**: Use service value scores to document:
- Prudent process in service provider selection
- Reasonableness of fees relative to services
- Ongoing monitoring of service adequacy
